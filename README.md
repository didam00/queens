## Difficulty generator

A lightweight difficulty-based puzzle generator is available in `js/difficultyGenerator.js`.
It supports the options `difficulty: 'random' | 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard'` and an optional
`seed` value to allow deterministic puzzles for testing.

The main UI now lets you choose the desired difficulty (random, easy, medium, hard) from the
settings modal. The current difficulty is shown at the top of the page.
